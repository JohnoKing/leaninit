.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm LeanInit
is a BSD-style init system that is developed for Linux and FreeBSD.
.Pp
When
.Nm LeanInit
is executed, it will detect if it is running as
.Nm PID
1.
.Pp
If it is
.Nm PID
1,
.Nm LeanInit
will open
.Em /dev/console
using
.Nm login_tty(3)
then launch two threads, one to kill all zombie processes, the other to run
.Nm lrc(8)
in multi-user mode or a shell in single user mode.
.Pp
If it is not
.Nm PID
1,
.Nm LeanInit
will instead read argv and do the following for each option:
.Pp
.Nm 0
Turn off the system.

.Nm 1, S, s
Switch the runlevel to single user (1).

.Nm 2, 3, 4, 5
Switch the runlevel to multi-user (5).

.Nm 6
Reboot the system.

.Nm 7
Halt the system.

.Nm 8
Hibernate the system (Linux only).

.Nm Q, q
Reload the current runlevel.

.Nm --version
Displays
.Nm LeanInit's
version number to the user.

.Nm --help
Displays
.Nm LeanInit's
usage information to the user.
.Pp
.Nm LeanInit
accepts the following arguments before booting:

.Nm -s, single
Start the system in single user mode.

.Nm silent
Enables Silent Mode, which turns off verbose output during boot.

.Nm quiet silent
Enables Silent Mode in addition to the quiet flag, completely removing all unwanted verbose output during boot.
.Sh SIGNALS
When
.Nm LeanInit
is sent a signal using
.Nm kill(1),
it will act as follows:

.Nm SIGHUP
Restarts the current runlevel.

.Nm SIGTERM
Sends the system into single user mode.

.Nm SIGILL
Sends the system into multi-user mode.

.Nm SIGUSR1
Halts the system.

.Nm SIGUSR2
Turns off the system.

.Nm SIGINT
Reboots the system.
.Sh OUTPUT
.Nm LeanInit
outputs text with the following color coding:

.Nm Cyan star and White text:
A generic message sent from one of
.Nm LeanInit's
binaries.

.Nm Purple star and White text:
A generic message that is not logged.

.Nm Blue star and White text:
