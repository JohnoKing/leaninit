.Sh NAME
.Nm leaninit
.Nd a fast init system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm init [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | S | s | Q | q ]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm LeanInit
is a BSD-style init system that is developed for Linux and FreeBSD.
.Pp
When
.Nm LeanInit
is executed, it will detect if it is running as
.Nm PID
1.
.Pp
If it is
.Nm PID
1,
.Nm LeanInit
will open
.Em /dev/console
using
.Nm login_tty(3)
then launch two threads, one to kill all zombie processes, the other to run
.Nm lrc(8)
in multi-user mode or a shell in single-user mode.
.Pp
If it is not
.Nm PID
1,
.Nm LeanInit
will instead do the following:
.Pp
.Nm 0
Turn off the system

.Nm 1, S, s
Switch the runlevel to single-user (1)

.Nm 2, 3, 4, 5
Switch the runlevel to multi-user (5)

.Nm Q, q
Restart the current runlevel

.Nm 6
Reboot the system
.Pp
Passing -s to
.Nm LeanInit
before booting will cause it to start the
system in single user mode.
.Sh SIGNALS
When
.Nm LeanInit
is sent a signal using
.Nm kill(1),
it will act as follows:

.Nm SIGHUP
Restarts the current runlevel.

.Nm SIGTERM
Sends the system into single-user mode.

.Nm SIGILL
Sends the system into multi-user mode.

.Nm SIGUSR1
Halts the system.

.Nm SIGUSR2
Turns off the system.

.Nm SIGINT
Reboots the system.
.Sh OUTPUT
.Nm LeanInit
outputs text with the following color coding:

.Nm Cyan star and White text:
A generic message from the
.Nm LeanInit
binary

.Nm Purple star and White text:
A generic message that is not logged

.Nm Blue star and White text:
A generic message that is logged

.Nm Green star and White text:
A message that indicates a successful action

.Nm Purple star and Yellow text:
A warning message

.Nm Red star and Red text:
