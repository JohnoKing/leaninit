.Dt INIT 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm leaninit
.Nd a fast init system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm init
.Oo
.Nm 0 | 6
.Sh DESCRIPTION
LeanInit is a BSD-style init system developed for Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.
When LeanInit is executed, it will first check if it is running as
.Nm PID
1.
.Pp
If it is
.Nm PID
1, LeanInit will run
.Nm login_tty(3)
to open the initial tty,
.Em /dev/tty1
on Linux and
.Em /dev/ttyv0
on FreeBSD. It will then output basic system information
to the initial tty and run
.Nm lrc(8)
as a child process. After
.Nm lrc(8)
is executed, LeanInit will suspend its own execution until it receives a signal.
.Pp
If it is not
.Nm PID
1, LeanInit will instead emulate a few System V-like options.
The following options available are:
.Pp
.Nm 0
Power-off

.Nm 6
Reboot

Passing -s to LeanInit before booting  will cause it to start the
system in single user mode. Switching to single user mode by running 'init 1'
is currently not possible.
.Pp
.Sh FILES
.Em /etc/leaninit.d/rc
Primary init script run by LeanInit

.Em /etc/rc
Secondary init script that is run if
.Em /etc/leaninit.d/rc
does not exist.

.Em /etc/leaninit.d/rc.conf
Provides config settings for
.Nm lrc(8)
and LeanInit scripts

.Em /etc/leaninit.d/rc.svc
Provides variables and functions for LeanInit scripts

.Em /etc/leaninit.d/rc.shutdown
Stops all services and unmounts
on all file systems during shutdown,
before LeanInit calls
.Nm reboot(2).

.Em /etc/leaninit.d/svc.d
Folder containing scripts for starting various services (such as D-BUS).

.Em /etc/leaninit.d/svc.e
Location of all files read to determine if a service is enabled.

.Em /var/log/leaninit/leaninit.log
Default log file for LeanInit, used by
.Nm rc.svc(8).

.Em /var/run/leaninit
Default location for LeanInit's .status and PID files
