.Sh NAME
.Nm linit
.Nd a fast init system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm init
.Oo
.Nm 0 | 6
.Sh DESCRIPTION
LeanInit is a Research Unix/BSD-style init system developed for Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.
The executable for LeanInit is named
.Nm linit
on normal installations, and
.Nm init
on override installations.
When LeanInit is executed, it will first check if it is running as
.Nm PID
1.
.Pp
If it is
.Nm PID
1, LeanInit will run
.Nm login_tty(3)
to open the initial tty,
.Em /dev/tty1
on Linux and
.Em /dev/ttyv0
on FreeBSD. It will then output basic system information
to the initial tty and run
.Nm rc(8)
as a child process. After
.Nm rc(8)
is executed, LeanInit will suspend its own execution until it receives a signal.
.Pp
If it is not
.Nm PID
1, however, LeanInit will instead read from argv to emulate a few System V-like options.
The following options available are:
.Pp
.Nm 0
Power-off

.Nm 6
Reboot
