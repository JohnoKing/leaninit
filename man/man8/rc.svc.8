.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.svc
.Nd provides functions and variables to LeanInit scripts
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rc.svc
script is responsible for reading
.Em /etc/leaninit/rc.conf,
then providing all required
variables and functions to
.Nm LeanInit's
various scripts, including
.Nm rc(8), rc.shutdown(8)
and all scripts located in
.Em /etc/leaninit/svc.d
.Pp

The following functions and variables are provided by
.Nm rc.svc:

.Em $PATH
.Nm rc.svc
will set the path to
.Em /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin,
then load
.Em /etc/profile


.Nm exifex
.Nm ExIfEx (Execute If Exists)
will execute the given command if it is valid, otherwise it silently returns zero.


.Nm print
This function prints formatted output to
.Em stdout.

If $2 is set to 'log', then the output from print will be logged to the log file.
$3 defines the ANSI color of at least the star and $4 (if set) defines the color of the text.

The following color variables (in bold form) are provided by
.Nm rc.svc:

.Em $RESET
Resets the text format (advised when using custom colors)

.Em $RED

.Em $BLUE

.Em $YELLOW

.Em $GREEN

.Em $PURPLE

.Em $CYAN

.Em $WHITE


.Nm waitfor type name [optional]...

.Nm waitfor
This function allows scripts to have dependency management
by letting them wait for a specified 'type' before proceeding.
.Nm Waitfor
will wait for a maximum of seven seconds when called,
and will stop when the required condition is true.
If a full seven seconds have elapsed,
.Nm waitfor
will cause the running script to exit with a return status of one.

.Nm file
This type will wait for the specified file to be created.

.Nm process
This type will wait for the specified process to start. Appending 'return' as a third argument will cause waitfor to return an exit status rather than killing the script.

.Nm service
This type will wait for the specified service to start.
Appending 'optional' as a third argument will cause waitfor to simply return if the service does not exist.

.Nm other
Other types will cause waitfor to look for '/var/run/leaninit/TYPENAME.type', in a similar manner to the 'file' and 'service' types.
Appending 'optional' as a third argument will cause waitfor to simply return if the type does not exist.


.Nm run
This function is used to run init scripts with standard arguments such as 'start' and 'stop'.
.Sh FILES
.Em /etc/leaninit/rc.conf
Provides config settings for
.Nm rc(8)
and
.Nm LeanInit
scripts.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Wait for HALD to launch:

waitfor service hald

Wait for a networking service to launch:

waitfor networking

Print colored output with a blue star and white text to
.Em /dev/tty
and the log file:

print "General informative message..." log ${BLUE} ${WHITE}

Run an init script using the
.Nm run()
function:

run "$@"
