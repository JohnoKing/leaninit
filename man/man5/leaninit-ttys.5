.Sh NAME
.Em /etc/leaninit/ttys
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em /etc/leaninit/ttys
is the file the
.Nm LeanInit
reads from for the list of TTYs to launch
.Nm getty(8)
on.
Each line should consist of two arguments separated by the ':' delimiter.
The first argument is the command that LeanInit will run (this command
must specify the file path to
.Nm getty
as the
.Em $PATH
variable is not used).
The second argument should have the path to the TTY that the
.Nm getty
will run on.
The
.Nm ttys
file may have comments that start with '#', although
all comments must be placed on their own line.
The maximum size of this file is 8,000 bytes,
with the maximum number of lines being 60.
.Sh EXAMPLE
# This will cause
.Nm agetty(8)
to launch on /dev/console and /dev/tty4

 /sbin/agetty console 38400 linux:/dev/console
 /sbin/agetty tty4 38400 linux:/dev/tty4
