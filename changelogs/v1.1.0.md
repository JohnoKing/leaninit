**Release v1.1.0 Changelog:**
* Replaced the broken Quiet Mode with Silent Mode. To enable Silent Mode, put 'quiet silent' into the command line of your bootloader (such as in /etc/default/grub).
* Added a new variable called $__svcpidfile, use this instead of manually writing the path to the PID file when creating a service script.
* Removed an unnecessary occurrence of exit(1) at the end of rc.svc(8).
* Replaced usage of type(1) with usage of command(1) to avoid redirecting output to /dev/null twice per command check.
* Made a few minor improvements to the code comments.
* Updated the rc.svc(8) man page.
