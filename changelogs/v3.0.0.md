**NOTICE:** LeanInit v3's rc.conf configuration is not backward compatible with previous versions. Reconfigure rc.conf and xdm.conf when upgrading to v3.

**Release v3.0.0 Changelog:**
* Separated service specific configs into `/etc/leaninit/rc.conf.d` (such as `xdm.conf`).
* You can now specify multiple network interfaces on FreeBSD like on Linux.
* Shortened many services by removing comments that were undescriptive.
* Increased the stability of the dhcpcd and elogind services.
* The man pages are now even more accurate.
* Removed the `$(RC)` variable from the primary Makefile.
