**NOTICE:** LeanInit v3's rc.conf configuration is not backward compatible with previous versions. Reconfigure rc.conf and xdm.conf when upgrading to v3.

**Release v3.0.0 Changelog:**
* Separated service specific configs into `/etc/leaninit/rc.conf.d` (such as `xdm.conf`).
* You can now specify multiple network interfaces on FreeBSD like on Linux.
* Added a debug setting called `DELAY` to leaninit-rc.conf(5).
* `noatime` is now used by default when mounting file systems in leaninit-rc(8) to increase performance.
* Optimized usage/reading of arguments, uname(2) and the main `for(;;)` loop in `init.c`.
* Removed undescriptive comments from the service scripts.
* Replaced the mingetty example in the default leaninit-ttys(5) file with a BusyBox getty example.
* Fixed a bug that caused a seven second delay when switching from single user mode to multi-user mode.
* Increased the stability of strings using `!` by using single quotes when possible (without enclosing quotes in `\`).
* Increased the stability of the dhcpcd and elogind services.
* C style syntax is now used for the brackets of functions in scripts.
* Removed usage of head(1) to increase performance.
* Removed excessive man page references throughout LeanInit.
* The man pages are now even more accurate.
* Removed the `$(RC)` variable from the primary Makefile.
