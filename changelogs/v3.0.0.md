**NOTICE:** LeanInit v3's rc.conf configuration is not backward compatible with previous versions. Reconfigure rc.conf and xdm.conf when upgrading to v3.

**Release v3.0.0 Changelog:**
* Separated service specific configs into `/etc/leaninit/rc.conf.d` (such as `xdm.conf`).
* You can now specify multiple network interfaces on FreeBSD like on Linux.
* Added a debug setting called `DELAY` to rc.conf(5).
* `noatime` is now used by default when mounting file systems in rc(8) to increase performance.
* Shortened many services by removing comments that were undescriptive.
* Replaced the mingetty example in the default ttys(5) file with a BusyBox getty example.
* Fixed a bug that caused a seven second delay when switching from single user mode to multi-user mode.
* Increased the stability of the dhcpcd and elogind services.
* The man pages are now even more accurate.
* Removed the `$(RC)` variable from the primary Makefile.
