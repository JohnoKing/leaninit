**Release v2.1.0 Changelog:**
* Separated service specific configs into `/etc/leaninit/rc.conf.d` (such as `xdm.conf`). Although the change is mostly backward compatible, reconfiguring leaninit-rc.conf(5) is recommended.
* Shortened many services by removing comments that were undescriptive.
* The man pages are now even more accurate.
* Removed the `$(RC)` variable from the primary Makefile.
