**v1.2.0 Beta 1 Changelog:**
* Added a brand new tool called osindications(8). This tool will change the value(s) of the OsIndications UEFI variable when it is run, allowing you to boot into the system firmware's UI with a simple reboot (alternatively, you can schedule an automatic boot into the firmware UI after a normal shutdown using this tool).
     * The immutable attribute is automatically removed from OsIndications (if it wasn't already) when the system boots to allow for this new feature to work.
     * The osindications(8) tool as of now only works on Linux. A port of osindications(8) to FreeBSD is planned for sometime in the future.
* Very minor code cleanup and adjustments for performance have been made.
* Moved the stall tool to the new ./tools directory.
* Reverted the following change from **v1.0.2**: The command `mv "$LOGFILE.2" "$LOGFILE.old.2"` in `rc(8)` is now seperated from the script using `&`.
