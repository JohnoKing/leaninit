**Release v3.2.0 Changelog:**
* Services will now accept a second argument that toggles verbose output.
* `$__SVC` is now obsolete as `$NAME` is used instead to verify if the script is a normal service.
* The Makefile for the debug programs is now shorter, with mrproper an alias to clean instead of clobber (as clobber is the same as clean).
* Changed 'Show' to 'Shows' in the leaninit-rc.svc(8) man page.
* Two junk space characters ` ` have been removed from the README.
