**v1.0-RC2 Changelog:**
* Removed LGetty's debug mode as it was buggy and mostly useless.
* LGetty will now return a proper exit status when its child process fails.
* Increased the stability of single user mode when switching runlevels.
* LeanInit now uses execve(2) instead of execl(3) in both single user and multi user mode (LGetty is unaffected). This will allow for greater flexibility when writing /etc/rc implementations in a different programming language than POSIX shell (such as Python) and executing other programs aside from normal shells when starting single user mode.
* Removed inaccurate information from the lrc.conf(5) man page.
