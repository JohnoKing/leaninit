**v1.2.0 Beta 7 Changelog:**
* Added a new init script function called isfunc(). This function will return 0 if the command given to it is a shell function. If the command is anything else (such as a shell builtin), or if it does not exist, isfunc will return 1.
* Fixed a bug that caused enabling a service to list shell builtins when /bin/bash is symlinked to /bin/sh.
* Added more usage information for commands to the rc.svc(8) man page.
